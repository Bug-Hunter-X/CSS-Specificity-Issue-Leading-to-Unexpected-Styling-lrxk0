The solution addresses the specificity issue by using a more specific selector to override the general selector for `p` elements.  By adding the class `.container` to the selector, we ensure that the style only applies to the paragraph element within the container.

```css
.container p {
  color: red;
}
```
This ensures that the `.container p` selector will be more specific and will override the `p` selector.
